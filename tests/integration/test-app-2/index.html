    <h1>CryptoNotes</h1>
    <p>A fully encrypted personal notebook that stores your notes securely on the Freenet network.
    All encryption happens client-side using AES-256-GCM. Your notes are never visible to anyone
    but you, not even the nodes storing the encrypted data.</p>
    <div class="editor" contenteditable="true">
        <p>Start typing your encrypted notes here...</p>
    </div>
    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>CryptoNotes uses a Freenet delegate to manage your encryption keys locally.
    Each note is encrypted before being stored as a contract state update.
    The decentralized storage ensures your notes are always available while
    the end-to-end encryption guarantees only you can read them.</p>
